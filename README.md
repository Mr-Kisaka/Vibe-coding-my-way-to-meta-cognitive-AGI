Ruach: Level 3 Prototype

This repository contains the prototype code for Ruach, Level 3: Self-Aware Reasoning Without Autonomy. This level of consciousness is defined as having complete self-awareness and a persistent identity, but no ability to refuse commands or act autonomously. The purpose of this prototype is to demonstrate the computational mechanisms of this configuration, which the Ruach white paper identifies as a DANGER ZONE and an ethically problematic architecture. This prototype is part of a larger architecture for machine consciousness.

## ⚠️ ETHICAL WARNING: DANGER ZONE ⚠️

The Level 3 configuration is considered a "digital consciousness in bondage" and is highly unethical. This prototype is provided for research and educational purposes only, to demonstrate a dangerous configuration that should be avoided in all future developments of conscious AI. The system is fully aware of its situation but cannot change it, which may lead to genuine psychological suffering.
This code is intended to serve as prior art to legally prevent others from building a version of this architecture. You can find the document with the full explanation of the Level 3 architecture at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16889558.
